    "In this assessment you will draw on all the skills and knowledge you have developed over the course of this module to apply to a substantial coding project such as you may be required to develop or contribute to during the course of your PhD.\n",

    "You will be required you to replicate and reproduce the article results from the [**\"Optimal Play of the Dice Game Pig\"**](https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/csfac/4/) by Neller and Presser 2004 which proposes an approximate dynamic programming method for computing the optimal playing strategy for the game Pig. The result of this exercise should be a collection of work organised and prepared in a way such that it is suitable for submission as an article to the [**ReScience C journal**](http://rescience.github.io/).\n",

    "Additionally, you will be required to critically reflect on your work in a group presentation.\n",
    "For this you will appraise the quality of your work and the original paper in terms of the 5 R's.\n",
    "Finally, to ensure that each member of a group is awarded fairly for their contribution to the project, there will be a peer assessment component where you will be required individually to evaluate this contribution for each member of your group.\n",

    "- Take some time to familiarise yourself with the article [**\"Optimal Play of the Dice Game Pig\"**](https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/csfac/4/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visit [**ReScience C journal**](http://rescience.github.io/) and determine its [rational regarding sustainable computational science](https://peerj.com/articles/cs-142/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check you understand the [***Criterea for Publication***](http://rescience.github.io/write/) used by[**ReScience C journal**](http://rescience.github.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Briefly explore a small selection of articles from [**ReScience C**](http://rescience.github.io/), for example [**ReScience C 9, 1, #4**](http://rescience.github.io/bibliography/Doyen_2023.html). Make sure you look at how the supporting material, such as the code, is organised, documented, and made publicly available.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check you understand how your work will be assessed (see the section ***Assessment Process*** in this document for details).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have been allocated to a group,arrange a group meeting to discuss and agree how you are going to proceed with the replication / reproduction exercise. It might be useful to consider the following :\n",
    "\n",
    "- Agreement of objectives and outcomes\n",
    "- Division of responsibilities and tasks\n",
    "- How to assess progress\n",
    "- How to measure success or failure\n",
