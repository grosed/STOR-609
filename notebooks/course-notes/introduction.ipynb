    "This program of study sets out to build an understanding of how to design and create high quality scientific software. Typically a practitioner acquires this understanding through years of practice and experience, and the underlying ideas and processes that it consists of are only rarely, if indeed ever, made explicit. This is not unusual in itself. In fact (at least in the United Kingdom), a complete program of scientific training can be undertaken, starting in school and finishing in graduate study, with no explicit reference ever being made to any specific scientific methodologies or their underlying principles and philosophical origins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe this is not a bad thing ? Indeed, by its very nature, a scientific methodology is unlikely to capture all the aspects associated with \"doing\" science, such as **(something here + references)**. Furthermore, in practice, and for many people, \"doing\" something is often much more enjoyable than \"thinking\" about it. Of course, when considering academics, the converse is often true, especially when it comes to philosophers !!   \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, maybe somewhere between the two extremes is a good place to position a post graduate level course on scientific programming. It is this approach that has been adopted here. In doing so it is hoped that the student will acquire an understanding that has more fundamental and therefore (it is hoped) broader in application. For example, software design is studied in a language \"agnostic\" way, focussing on the core abstractions and ideas that make for good software design. However, the student is also required to realise these designs using a one or more programming languages and systems and, in doing so, acquire some of the day to day practical skills necessary for creating quality scientific software.\n",
    "\n",
    "A further hoped for benefit of teaching programming in a language agnostic manner is that it furnishes the student with the ability to assess the suitability and limitations of any particular language within the context of a given problem domain. This is not just wishful thinking. It is based on the belief that  "
