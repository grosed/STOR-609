    "Most practitioners would broadly agree with the preceding claim. Consequently, there is a large body of high quality and readily available work providing guidance to programmers with a scientific background. Most of these focus almost entirely on the details of *how* to do this e.g. commenting and documenting code, choosing sensible variable names, organising code across multiple files - even rules for how to lay your code out; the list goes on. However, they tend not to discuss *why* this should be done. \n",

The rationale for this approach is simple - the desired qualities for the software do not change over time but, as we are all aware, the technology we use to create and maintain software does change and often very rapidly. Better then to fully understand the basic requirements so that we can translate this into ways of working the current technology and also be able to adapt our working practices as new technology emerges.
