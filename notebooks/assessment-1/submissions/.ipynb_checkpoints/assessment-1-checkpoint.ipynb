    "The [backtracking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) is an algorithm which builds solutions to problems in an incremental manner and backtracks to previous partial solutions, when the algorithm encounters an infeasible solution.\n",
    "The core algorithm is described in terms of a set of abstract operations and can thus to applied to a very wide range of problems.\n",

    "This assessment requires that you implement a [backtracking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) to solve two problems.\n",
    "In both cases, the problem has been well studied, so you should be able to assess the correctness of your algorithm.\n",
    "In particular, the primary objective of the assessment is to produce a **reusable** implementation of the backtracking algorithm in the sense that the core code of the algorithm requires no modifications when used for solving the different problem types. \n",
    "For each problem, one should only need to specify the abstract operations required to run the backtracking algorithm.\n",
