    "The backtracking algorithm is a tool used to solve a specific subset of mathematical problems. It is most useful in problems where we can solve a problem in steps and can identify early on if a solution which we are in the process of building will not constitute a valid solution. It uses these to cut these solutions such that we do not waste computational resources exploring them further. This makes it very quick in such problems.\n",

For example, the number 4 has the following integer partitions: 4, 3 + 1, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. The problem can be solved by backtracking by considering an integer or multiple integers as partial solutions. These partial solutions can be branched off, and should either the sum of the integers surpass n, or we exhaust numbers to append to the list, we cut this solution branch. This branching and cutting of solutions makes it possible to solve the problem using backtracking. Note also that it is possible to find each of the functions specified as inputs for our backtracking, providing more compelling evidence for its use.\n",

We chose to use lists as they are highly flexible, with the ability to add and remove elements easily and dynamically as is required in this problem. For our general backtracking function, we allowed the inputs to be functions which were versatile enough to be used on a large number of similar problems which could be solved using backtrcking. I decided not to use any of the functional patterns as firstly there were no clear opportunities to do this where I felt it would have found a quicker or more accurate solution, and also I felt that this would add extra complexity to the problem, and this generally makes the code less reusable if it were to pass into someone elses' hands."

    "\n",
    "Overall, the backtracking implementation is reusable - once it had been created for the n-partitions problem, it was able to be used straight away for the Gray Code problem by only changing the input functions, not the code itself. One issue with the way in which the functions are used is that it is not essential that all of the functions carry out the purpose for which they were designed, and the algorithm can run well by putting these tasks into the other functions. An interesting area for improvement would therefore be to strictly stay within the uses of each function, as for the Gray code the reject function is encapsulated within the next function. Broadly speaking though, the algorithm generally performs well and finds accurate solutions quickly, and it would not be a stretch of the imagination to see that classical problems such as the N-Queens problem could be solved easily within the same framework."
