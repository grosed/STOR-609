    "    1) Abstracts the Decision Process: Accepts a list of branch functions. Each branch function is responsible for making one type of decision and, if applicable, modifying the current state.\n",
    "    2) Manages States: Depending on the problem, the state may be mutable or require a deep copy to avoid cross-contamination between branches. We provide a copy_state function to make sure that each recursive branch works with an independent copy.\n",

    "**CONCLUSIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation gives a reusable backtracking function for generating Gray codes and integer partitions. It also allows users to input values interactively, making it adaptable to different problem sizes. The use of functions for Gray code generation (gray_codes, gray_codes_binary) and integer partitioning (integer_partitions) is modular, making the code easy to modify and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reusability**\n",
    "1) The general backtracking function can be reused independently in applications other than Gray codes or integer partitions- it allows users to define their own branching logic and stopping conditions, making it adaptable to different problems.\n",
    "2) Two-branch-gray wrapper is adaptable for problems like Knapsack and scheduling, where recursive state transitions can be formulated using two branches.\n",
    "3) The modular structure allows for integration of additional features, such as custom ordering or different encoding schemes.\n",
    "4) The performance measurements given can be used to compare it to similar algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "1) Scalability Issues: Gray code generation grows exponentially (O(2^n) complexity), leading to memory and execution time constraints for n > 20.\n",
    "Integer partitions also grow rapidly, affecting time and memory for larger m. But most of this is from the complexity inherent to the algorithm.\n",
    "2) Local Jupyter Notebook Limitations: For n > 15, output limitations require increasing data rate limit (majorly becuase of the size of printed output). Google Colab automatically manages this, making it a better environment for larger values of n.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Improvements**\n",
    "1) Better Storage: Instead of storing full Gray code lists, generate codes dynamically using bitwise operations to reduce memory.\n",
    "2) Parallel Processing: Large-scale Gray code computations could be parallelized to improve efficiency.\n",
    "3) Error Handling: More robust handling for cases where n or m are too large and may cause performance issues."
