    "The backtracking algorithm is an incremental and recursive search algorithm used to solve problems by exploring possible solutions and then retreating to search from earlier nodes when there is a rejection. This suggests that the backtracking algorithm can be considered a 'brute force' approach to finding solutions since it relies on trial-and-error to get a solution set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The general algorithm described simply is such that:\n",
    "1. Choose an initial solution, or state.\n",
    "2. Determine the possible extensions of the current solution or state.\n",
    "3. If the extension results in a successful solution, accept it and store the solution.\n",
    "4. If the extension is unsuccessful, backtrack to the previous solution and try an alternative extension.\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all possible solutions have been retrieved or some stopping condition is met.\n",

    "The components which are required to build a backtracking system are:\n",
    "- A function providing the **intial state**: This should provide the starting point for the algorithm, based on the problem.\n",
    "- A **rejection** function: This should evaluate the proposed candidate and then reject it if it does not meet the constraints of the problem, and is therefore not worth completing.\n",
    "- An **acceptance** function: This should evaluate whether the proposed candidate, which was not rejected as rejection occurs before acceptance in the backtracking algorithm, is a solution to the problem.\n",
    "- A function **generating extensions** of the state: This function should provide the extensions given a current state.\n",
    "- A **backtracking** function: This core function should implement the recursive backtracking algorithm, making decisions based on calls to the acceptance and rejection functions where needed.\n",
    "- A **solver** function: This function should orchestrate the backtracking algorithm by initialising the state and starting the backtracking algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalise the problem as much as possible, we implement these functions within a base `Backtrack` class. The only methods fully implemented in the base class are the backtrack function, which performs the backtracking, and the solver, which orchestrates initialisation and the backtracking algorithm. The initial state function, the acceptance and rejection functions as well as the extension function should be implemented in the child classes since these are problem-specific, whereas the backtracking function and its solver are completely generic and should fit all relevant problems that can be solved with backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also note that in order to keep the backtracking algorithm as generic as possible, we need to introduce a boolean parameter called `find_all`. In some problems we will need to find all of the possible solutions in which case this should be set to True. An example of this is the integer partitioning problem where we wish to find all of the integer partitions of a given number. In other cases, we may wish to stop the backtracking algorithm at the first valid solution. An example of this is the gray code problem where we wish to obtain a possible gray code sequence (i.e. 11, 10, 01, 00) but not all possible gray code sequences (i.e. {11, 10, 01, 00}, {11, 01, 10, 00}, {00, 01, 10, 11} etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining all of these elements, we can write pseudocode for the backtracking algorithm:\n",
    "1. **Initialise**:\n",
    "    - Initialise a storage structure for the solution(s).\n",
    "    - Set the `find_all` boolean to determine whether to find all valid solutions or just stop at the first valid one.\n",
    "    - Obtain the initial state of the problem.\n",
    "2. **Recursive backtracking** (given a `state`):\n",
    "    - Rejection Check: If the `state` is found to be invalid according to the problem's constraints, end this path without returning a result.\n",
    "    - Acceptance Check: If the `state` is a valid solution:\n",
    "        - Store it in the solution set.\n",
    "        - If `find_all` is False, return the solution immediately (stopping early).\n",
    "    - Explore Extensions:\n",
    "        - Generate all possible next states (i.e. extensions of the current state).\n",
    "        - For each possible next state:\n",
    "            - Recursively apply the backtracking algorithm.\n",
    "            - If a valid solution is found and `find_all` is False, return the result immediately.\n",
    "3. **Output**:\n",
    "    - If solution(s) were found, return them. Otherwise, return an empty result.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that in this algorithm, we only perform the acceptance check after the rejection check and hence we do not need to duplicate the same constraint requirements in both of these functions (acceptance and rejection).\n"

    "To solve this problem with backtracking we need to define an initial state, rejection criteria, acceptance criteria and the method for extending a current state. The general idea is that the extension to a given state would add a single integer to the current state and this is repeated until the partition sums to the target n and failing partitions are discarded. In the case of a failed partition, we would need to backtrack to the last acceptable state and explore from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need to define what a state would be in this context. A state is made up of an integer partition (here represented as a list of integers), and an integer representing how far off the sum of the partition's values are from the target n (i.e. what sum is remaining to get to the target of n). The initial state can then be considered as the empty set (the partition), and the number n (i.e. the empty set requires a sum of n integers to meet the target n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we will define how we can extend upon the set. Consider two cases:\n",
    "1. **We have an empty partition** (as in the beginning of the problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the number remaining to get to the target is n. We will want to propose extensions to the empty partition: [1], [2], ..., [n]. Since the state has form (partition, remaining), the states of these extensions will be ([1], n-1), ([2], n-2), ..., ([n], 0). This pattern implies our extensions need to add integers to the empty partition from 1 to the number remaining to get to the target n, which is n.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **We have a non-empty partition proposed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the candidate partition has values in it. \n",
    "Suppose we take [2] as our example candidate partition. Note that the extensions from the last case will be considered in order: [1], [2], ..., [n] in the backtracking algorithm so we will first consider the branch where the leading number is 1 fully before considering the branch where the leading number is 2 and so on.\n",
    "If we follow the strategy outlined above where we add integers ranging from 1 to the number remaining (i.e., n-2) we would consider extensions: [2, 1], [2, 2], ..., [2, n-2]. Given that we would have already explored the branch with leading number 1 (i.e. all extensions of [1]), we would have already considered all of the variants of [1, 2]. We foresee then that we would have a huge degree of overlap in the branches stemming from [1, 2] and [2, 1]. This is computationally inefficient as the ordering of the numbers in the partition do not matter in the integer partitioning problem. We would need to implement a method detecting duplicates in the `reject` method of the algorithm to handle the cases above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid needing to detect duplicates and exploring redundant branches, we can propose extensions/ candidates in a smarter way. We can maintain ordered partitions to prevent overlaps between candidate solutions. In this way, if we have partition [1] we would only consider extension [1, 1] and if we consider candidate [2], we would have extensions [2, 1] and [2, 2]. This means we only allow the algorithm to propose an extension where the order in the partition goes from biggest to smallest. In this case, we do not add integers to the partition where the next integer is smaller than the last one in the partition. This stops us from considering any duplicate partitions and also saves us from requiring to check for duplicates which would be computationally expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is only one way of performing extension. Alternatively, we could have added only numbers equal to or larger than the last number in the partition up to the number remaining so that our partitions are ordered from smallest to biggest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have defined the initial state and the extension method, we consider the rejection and acceptance criteria. A partition will be rejected if the number remaining to get to the target is negative (which would mean we have overshot the target) and it will be accepted only when the number remaining to get to the target is 0 (i.e. the sum of the integers in the partition is exactly n).\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods are implemented below and note that we set `find_all` to True so that we find all of the possible integer partitions of the number n (and not just the first valid partition)."

Ultimately, tuples and lists are quite similar in this context since to add to the data structure we need to make a copy and append to it with `new_partition = partition.copy(); new_partition.append(additional_integer)`. This is effectively the same as `new_partition = partition + (additional_integer,)` if `partition` is a tuple since it makes a copy in the background."

    "In this problem we need to generate a gray code sequence which is a list of consecutive bit sequences of a given length n. There are three constraints:\n",
    "1. No two elements in the gray code sequence can be duplicates.\n",
    "2. Each consecutive bit sequence should have a difference of only one bit - that is, the hamming distance between consecutive bit sequences should be exactly one.\n",
    "3. Gray codes are cyclic in the sense that the last entry in the gray code sequence must be a single bit different from the first entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is not one single solution to this problem - a large number of solutions exist for any given value of n. For example consider n = 2 and initial state 00. We can have sequence [00, 01, 11, 10] or [00, 10, 11, 01] and both of these are valid. For this problem we only want to find a single valid solution and stop the algorithm early at that point in time (i.e. `find_all` is False).\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, we only need to define the initial solution, the rejection and acceptance criteria and the method of extension. We can begin with the initial state where all n bits are 0 (which in this code is represented by False for simplicity in the extension method). We can define the state of the problem as a list of accepted bit sequences, where each bit sequence is a tuple of booleans. The value for False is equivalent to 0 and True represents 1. If we were to run this problem with `find_all` = True then we would obtain every possible, valid gray sequence for the value of n. Since `find_all` is False, we stop when the state is a single valid gray code sequence for n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will discuss the extension method for this problem. Given a current state, create modifications of the last bit sequence in the gray code sequence where each bit is flipped once. For example, if we have n = 5 and state 01011 then we have 5 potential extensions: 11011, 00011, 01111, 01001 and 01010. The modifications are the copy of the original state with a single position having the opposite value. This extension method implicitly prevents violations of the hamming distance constraint by only allowing a single bit change per consecutive pair of bit sequences. We therefore do not need to consider this constraint in the rejection method as it is implicitly handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only rejection criterion to check for then is the duplication constraint. We need to determine whether the proposed candidate exactly matches a bit sequence earlier in the gray code sequence. The acceptance criterion, evaluated after the rejection function, checks whether the gray code sequence is of length 2^n. It is known that the length of the resulting gray code sequence when each element has length n will be 2^n. The acceptance code also checks for the cyclic condition. Assuming the sequence is of length 2^n, the gray code sequence is only accepted if the first and last code differ by exactly one bit.\n",

    "One of the big questions about data structures for the gray code problem is whether to use lists or tuples to represent the partitions. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. If we use a list to represent the partition, we would not need to convert the tuple to a list in the `extensions` method to modify the partition (given that lists are mutable and tuples are immutable), and then convert it back to a tuple. The immutability of the tuple is however an advantage in the `reject` method where we check for duplicates in line `len(set(state)) != len(state)`. Converting a tuple to a list is possible because it is an immutable data structure - converting a list to a set runs into the error `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`. Using sets to find duplicates is quite efficient and hence it feels more suitable to utilise tuples even though we need to convert to lists in the `extensions` method.\n"

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reusability\n",
    "Reusable code is code that can be **easily adapted to different variants** of a problem and can be **easily integrated into other codebases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we tackle the element of **adaptability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that the code provided is highly adaptable on account of the class-based architecture utilised. The parent-child class based code provided is inherently reusable as the core backtracking algorithm and solver provided in the base class remains the same for all child classes. Therefore, the functionality which is non-problem specific is abstracted to the base class and any problem specific behaviour is provided in the child classes. This architecture ensures that the backtracking logic doesn't need to be replicated in the subclasses which reduces redundancy and promotes reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, methods of the classes are well seperated so that each method handles limited functionality. This ensures that the code is easier to maintain and update. This improves the adaptability and the integratability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we consider the ease at which the code can be **integrated into other codebases**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is very easy to integrate into other codebases. The reasons for this are outlined below:\n",
    "- **Linting & Formatting**: This code was linted and formatted using python packages `black`, `flake8` and `pylint`. The code, bar line length violations, is therefore PEP8 compliant and meets typical Python coding standards.\n",
    "- **Documentation**: Each method and class has type hints, lengthy docstrings as well as many inline comments to ensure that any other programmer will be able to follow the logic of the code to improve its integratability.\n",
    "- **Naming convention**: Typical conventions for naming have been followed so constants are uppercase, functions are in snake case and class names are in camel case. Furthermore, descriptive names for variables and functions have been used to promote understanding of all programmers reading through the code.\n",
    "- **Minimal dependency on external packages**: The only package utilised is the logging package which is a base Python package and does not require installation if Python is installed. This minimal reliance on packages is advantageous if the code is to be integrated into an existing codebase. By avoiding additional package dependencies, the code reduces risks of package version conflicts and also improves the maintainability of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations \n",
    "The biggest limitation of the gray code backtracking implementation is that when `n` is greater than 11, we reach maximum recursion depth. The implementation therefore requires improvement to ensure it is suitable for larger values of n. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested improvements\n",
    "The code could be improved by adding unit tests to ensure that the output is consistent and correct. Additionally, unit tests may give more insight on where additional errors should be raised.\n"
