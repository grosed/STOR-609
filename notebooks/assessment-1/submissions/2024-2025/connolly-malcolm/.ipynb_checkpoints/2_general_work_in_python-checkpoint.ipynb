    "If I had another problem which could be solved via backtracking, I would in principle be able to specify the methods in a class and reuse my $\\texttt{backtrack()}$ function. I only have had to write one backtrack algorithm which can be reused. This is an advantage over writing separate functions for each problem and even over alternative implementations which might copy and paste a backtrack method inside each of the Partition and Gray classes. Further I already demonstrated that the code can be adapted to the need for early stop conditions, so is also reusable in that sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "A convenient advantage of my implementation is that the initialisation method allows one to use different numbers in a similar way to partial application, without the need to specify the root directly as an input. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code for the Gray class requires a third party package due to copy a list of lists, which is not ideal. I found that the Python idiom $s[:]$ did not work within the class, and threw out the error \"IndexError: list index out of range\", so I had to replace it with the deepcopy. An area for improvement would be to investigate this issue, or look for an alternative data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially in the classes I used global variables, which may pollute the environment. I worked out the \"self.\" prefix and applied it here to avoid this, which adds to the robustness of the implementation, and could be beneficial particularly if reusing this method as part of a larger program.\n",
    "\n",
    "One area for improvement is adding data validation, at the moment I am assuming the user is sensible. Another area for improvement could be to consider a more general 'Backtracker' class from which Partition and Gray could be subclasses, though the details of how exactly to write general methods that are editable to a subclass are beyond me at this time. Further, print() output is rather limited and may be best stored to be accessed later. \n",
    "\n",
    "A major limitation is that of computing resources. For large numbers, we get an error \"RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded\". If the backtrack method were parallelisable, this could divide up the search space into more manageable computations. However this may be problem-specific and it was unclear to me how to do this in these instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally an area for further development which I did not explore would be to use memoisation, as both partitions and gray codes can be built up from smaller instances."
