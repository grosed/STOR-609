    "## Explanation of backtracking for partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I considered a partition as an ordered list of integers that sum to a given number $n$. For example if $n=10$, then $[6,3,1]$ is a partition, where I put the numbers in descending order. I also used an order between partitions. For example $[6,3,1]$ comes before $[6,2,2]$, which comes before $[6,2,1,1]$. This is the reverse of dictionary (lexicographic) order, where smaller numbers would normally come first.\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest possible number in a partition of $n$ is $n$ itself. The singleton list $n$ is the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtracking algorithm works by completing a partial partition by suggesting the smallest current number in the list, and if this is too big, reducing it by 1 until the smallest number in the list is 1, at which point we move to the smallest number which is greater than one and reduce this by 1. The process terminates when all numbers are $1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, given the partially complete partition $[6,3]$ of $10$, we would first suggest $[6,3,3]$ then $[6,3,2]$ then obtain $[6,3,1]$. We check the sum at each iteration and accept at the end of this chain. Once the last number in the list is $1$, we $\\textit{backtrack}$ to $[6,3]$, and reduce the last entry by one. The next suggested partial partition would be $[6,2]$, as we have exhausted possibilities with $3$ as the smallest number greater than $1$, and so the process continues to suggest $[6,2,2]$ then obtain $[6,2,1]$. \n",
    "\n",
