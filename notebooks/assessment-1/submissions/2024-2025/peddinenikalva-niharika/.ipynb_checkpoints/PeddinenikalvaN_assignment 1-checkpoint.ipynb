    "### Integer Partitioning\n",
    "#### What is integer partitioning?\n",
    "Integer partitions are ways of writing an integer $n$ as a sum of positive integers. If two sums differ only by the order of terms in the sum, they are considered to be the same partition, e.g., 2+3 and 3+2 are considered to be the same partition but 2+3 and 2+2+1 are considered to be different partitions of 5. An example for all the partitions of 4 are: \n",
    "- 1+1+1+1\n",
    "- 1+1+2\n",
    "- 1+3\n",
    "- 2+2\n",
    "- 4\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How can the problem be solved using backtracking?\n",
    "In the example above, we can see that it is possible to build a candidate which solves the integer partitioning problem by extending the summands and accepting/rejecting a series or further extending it. The backtracking of discarding a series which is not worth completing is useful in this problem. For example, suppose $n=3$. We can build a candidate by starting the root search with the series 1. We can extend the series to 1+1 and exploring further extensions until we find a unique partition of $n=3$. However, if we find a candidate 2+2, we may discard this candidate as it exceeds $n=3$, but it is also impossible to find a valid partition by extending this candidate further. Similarly, while we may accept a candidate 2+1, we would then discard this candidate as it is not worth exploring further for the same reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example to motivate the use of backtracking to solve this problem is given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $n=3$. \n",
    "- We start the root search with no summands, i.e., root candidate $c=()$. \n",
    "- A first extension $s$, could be including a new summand which repeats the last summand in the current candidate. For example, if $c = (1+1)$, then we can first extend it to $s = (1+1+1)$. Another example is extending the candidate $c = (1+2)$ to $s = (1+2+2)$\n",
    "- An alternative extension could be incrementing the last summand by 1. For example, an alternative extension to $c = (1)$ could be $s = (2)$. Another example is extending the candidate $c=(2+3)$ to $s=(2+4)$.\n",
    "- These extensions ensure that the summands are ordered in a non-decreasing manner. This helps to ensure that repeated candidates are not accepted as solutions.\n",
    "- We accept every candidate whose sum is equal to $n$.\n",
    "- We reject every candidate whose sum is greater than $n$ as it is not possible to find a solution by extending such candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we find solutions where the summands are in non-decreasing order and the first element of each partition found iteratively are found in a non-decreasing manner. This would result in finding all the partitions of an integer $n$ in an order akin to the example $n=4$ seen above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Designing the backtracking operations to solve the problem\n",

    "- The given problem data is the integer $n$ for which we must find all partitions.\n",
    "- A candidate in this problem is a partition and is denoted by a list containing integers, which are the summands of the partition.\n",
    "- A solution is a candidate (list) whose terms (elements) sum to exactly $n$. \n",
    "- The algorithm seeks to find all valid candidates, i.e., partitions of the integer $n$.\n",
    "- `root()`: the root search begins with an empty candidate partition (list) which can be extended in further iterations, i.e., $c = ()$.\n",
    "- `reject()`: the rejection step is carried out by rejecting any candidate which sums to a value greater than $n$.\n",
    "- `accept()`: the accept step is carried out by accepting any candidate which sums to a value equal to $n$.\n",
    "- The `accept()` and `reject()` functions return a boolean value.\n",
    "- `first()`: the first extension to a candidate (list) is to add the last element to the list only if the sum of the candidate is lesser than $n$. If the candidate sums to a value greater than or equal to $n$, the candidate is set as `None` (NULL object). For example, a first extension to `[1, 3]` is `[1, 3, 3]`.\n",
    "- `next()`: the alternative (or next) extension to a candidate (list) is to increment the last element of the list by 1. For example, an alternative extension to `[1, 3]` is `[1, 4]`.\n",
    "- `output()`: all accepted candidates are added to the list of accepted solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions `root()`, `reject()`, `accept()`, `first()`, `next()`, `output()` for this problem are defined in the code below. A partial application pattern is used in this problem using the `partial()` function from the the `functools` package. This allows us to partially implement the `backtrack()` function with the relevant functions `reject()`, `accept()`, `first()`, `next()`, `output()` for the integer partitioning problem. This partial function is stored as `integer_partitioning_solver()`. The inputs for this partial function are $n$, the root candidate (empty list) and the initial list of solutions (empty list).\n"

    "Conside the example above which implements the `gray_code_generator()` using the input $n=10$. This should generate a Gray code sequence of $2^{10} = 1024$ numbers. By checking the decimal number associated with each value, we can verify that there are 1024 values where two successive values differ by only one bit. Also, checking that the set of values has the same size as the list of values verifies the uniqueness of values in the sequence. Thus, we can see that the backtracking algorithm has been successfully used to generate a Gray code."

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the backtracking algorithm has an element of reusability since it could be used to solve two different computational problems. There were practically no adjustments required in the `backtrack()` algorithm structure when solving the two problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differences in applying the algorithm to solve the problems arose from the structure of the input functions. This highlights the reusability of the backtracking algorithm. In fact, the algorithm is known to solve several problems, such as the eight-queens puzzle and a suite of constraint-satisfaction problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the use of partial application functions enables us to utilize this reusable quality of the algorithm in order to solve the problem for different data inputs (in this case, values of $n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are limitations of using the algorithm to solve these problems. The algorithm works well for smaller instances of the problems. However, due to the recursive nature of backtracking, larger values of $n$ cause recursion errors. Further, as $n$ increases, the solution space increases and this causes increased computational costs for finding solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the integer partitioning problem for small values of $n$ upto $n=30$, the algorithm finds all integer partitions in less than 0.1 seconds (CPU time). However, for $n=40$ and $n=50$, the CPU times are 1.9 seconds and 14.4 seconds, respectively. Thus, as $n$ increases further, the magnitude of run times of the algorithm increases. For higher values of $n$, this algorithm may be impractical to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of Gray code generation, issues such as recursion errors for the algorithm for small values of $n \\geq 12$. The default recursion depth for Python is 1000. If we reset the max recursion depth to 50000, we can find a Gray code for $n \\leq 15$. Thus, a caveat of the backtracking algorithm for generating Gray codes is the recursion depth limit for small values of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of improvements, we could explore other ways of implementing the backtracking functions for the two problems. In the case of Gray code generation, the `next()` function is not relevant in its use. Finding an alternative implementation of the algorithm could possibly improve the performance of backtracking for solving this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Further, it may be worth exploring ways to improve the efficiency of the algorithm for both problems. This could allow a better use of backtracking for larger values of $n$ which may be relevant in real-world/more complex applications."
