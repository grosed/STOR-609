    "The backtracking algorithm uses a tree structure approach to bruteforce the possibilities of a complex typically combinatorial problem. The way this works is by traversing down to the root of a tree, trying to find a solution. If it finds something that satisfies the end condition, we finish, but if not we either store what we have found if necessary, or prune it due to its dead end. This typically uses a recursive function which repeatedly calls upon itself, which allows simple ways to traverse backwards along the tree when we are stuck. A generic algorithm pseudocode will be given below."

Similarly, we have reject() but this is only ran when a solution is known to be a dead end by some prior knowledge, or just found as a dead end. The first() function generates the first potential solution to look for in this particular branch, while the next() function looks for following solutions under a certain branch after first().\n",

If there are no feasible solutions, the function will just end without calling anything. The python equivalent of this pseudocode can be given as follows."

If a value doesn't exist such as at the start of the algorithm, it simply generates the trivial solution n. The algorithm then uses the accept() to check if it is a valid solution, or reject() if extending the current solution by adding more numbers will not lead to a possible solution.\n",

Downsides of this algorithm is that in the worst case it is equivalent to bruteforcing every solution, as well as the fact that certain programming languages cannot handle large number of recursions, thus the problem is only applicable on a relatively small scale. The code is very reusable for any problem to apply the backtracking algorithm to, the key function is the backtrack() function which can be copy pasted, with key is to change the accept, reject, first, next and root functions adjusting to its own individual problems."
