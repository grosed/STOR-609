This would amount to a more effective pruning of possible paths. \n",

We make use of a dict since we can search the keys in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ time, and also we can return an ordered list (the keys are returned in the order they are added in python 3.8 onwards). You could achieve a similar thing with a list which stores the ordered grey code numbers/ integer partitions, and a set to do lookup, but this is redundant in memory. "

    "There are a few possible avenues for development in my code. One is that each function for each different use case may require different arguments than other cases. For example, gn_undo_step needs to know the last step which took place, whereas in ip_undo_step, you simply pop the last bit. Defining these as partial functions could perhaps help clear up the API, allowing for only required arguments to be passed in. I did not do this in the end, since for the malleability of the class it is easiest if you offer each function everything it could possibly need, then each function just picks relevant args on its own. \n",

    "I think the usage of data structures throughout has been optimal. Using dictionary keys allows for order 1 lookup time, and also preserves the order in which they are added. \n",

    "Efficiency gains could be made by more accurately/ thoroughly checking candidate next_moves, so that you cannot end up revisiting the same states you were in before. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, I think the code is reusable and robust. Efficiency gains could be made with regard to navigating the solution space, and this would also allow for a reduction in length of the recursive stack. Further work would involve testing out the implementation on other problems in backtracking, and seeing if we are able to apply the same structure in other cases. If not, we have likely benefitted from some commonalities between these two problems without realising.  "
