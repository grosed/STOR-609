    "This assessment requires that you implement a [backtracking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) to solve a number of different although related problems. Some of the problems have been well studied and (in certain cases) have known solutions, so you should be able to assess the correctness of your algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of the assessment is to produce a **reusable** implementation of the backtracking algorithm in the sense that the core code of the algorithm requires  minimal modifications when used for solving a range of problem types. However, for each problem additional code can be provided that is then consumed (as inputs) by the core backtracking algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the backtracking algorithm may require a large amount of computational resource to solve the problems even for quite small values of the input parameters. You are expected to explore the problems for sensible choices of the problem parameters and you are required to describe and explain any strategies you use to mitigate the effects of this (see the assessment section below).    \n",
