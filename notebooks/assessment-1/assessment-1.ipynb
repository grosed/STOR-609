    "The primary objective of the assessment is to produce a **reusable** implementation of the backtracking algorithm in the sense that the core code of the algorithm requires  minimal modifications when used for solving a range of problem types. However, for each problem, additional code can be provided to provide inputs to the core backtracking algorithm. \n",
